> Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny. -[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)

## Learning Objectives 

* Create their own `for-in` loops where appropriate.
* Use `enumerate()` to get the `index` and `element` from the array.
* Create `Array` variables and constants and know how to use them.
* Know how to create an `Array` of `Int`'s and `String`'s. 
* Create functions that take in `Array`'s as arguments. 
* Access elements of the `Array` using *subscript syntax*.
* Change elements at a specific index using *subscript syntax*. 

## Instructions

* Open up the playground file included with this repo and answer the listed questions (which you will find in the playground file) in order. 
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* The following two screenshots are included to assist you in case the file doesn't open right to the main.swift file (which it should by default).
* Make sure you're working in the main.swift file (which you can view by pressing command + 0):
